        A data-driven assessment of water use by mining industry in Umnigobi aimag
      </p>

    
    
    <p>Given the history and inherently exploitative function of the mining industry, it is challenging to gauge the value exchange taking place between large corporations and local governments and herders in Umnugobi, an arid region in southern Mongolia. Leveraging vast mineral resources, national and local governments have allowed a large number of mining operations to jump-start economic activity in the country that has disrupted delicate ecologies. 
        The biggest disruption for the locals living a traditional nomadic life is competing for fresh water in a desert. 
        The local communities depend on scarce water sources for their daily household needs, agriculture, and sustaining livestock. 
        But due to mining, not only are they competing for water, but need to worry about its quality as well. </p> 
        <p>
        In 2016, a new water data disclosure standard and guidelines for participatory monitoring programs (PMPs) were established as an industry practice through a collaborative effort by the Chamber of Mines of Mongolia, IFC, and Mongolia Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (MEITI). This effort was aimed at providing community-led and data-driven oversight of local water management practices of mining operations by all stakeholders. Oyu Tolgoi LLC and Energy Resource LLC run the largest operations in the province among companies that have reported data through the new standards. Since they make up more than 95% of all water usage in the region, they have had PMPs setup since 2016. Hundreds of herders participate in surveys and monitoring activities every year. Several companies have also supported fixing old wells and helping locals in times of severe drought by providing water and other resources. Data shows that although the number of companies reporting their information has increased from 14 in 2017 to 18 in 2018, overall water use has dropped by 23% for the same period. Six out of seven companies sharing water-use data have not used a substantial portion of what they initially intended to use.  
        The water use tax data shows that over 15 M tugrugs were paid by companies in the area. Hence, about 5 million tugrugs would be available for local communities to support water conservation activities. A good use for this would be planting trees at strategic locations to reduce desertification processes that are exacerbated due to mining activity.        
    </p>
        <p>
        Balancing the use of water in a desert with the economic aspirations of a developing country is the challenge. But value being created may only become visible to all if data-driven oversight is maintained, ensuring companies continue to think beyond their fence.

    <h3>Beyond the Fence</h3>
    <p>This is the submission of a Printable visualization. The reason I am presenting a printable visualization and not a digital one with dashboards is that the goal is improve communication between herders community and locals and corporations running mining operations. The people receiving information mostly have never used a computer and cannot access web-based dashboards. Hence it did not make sense for me to develop fancy maps or a dashboard. Instead I present a printable one-pager that intends to catch the eye of a reader with meaningful yet simple data-driven facts. Hopefully this would be translated into Mongolian language before sharing it with real local community.</p>

        Supporting Data-driven Initiatives in Populations with Accessibility Challenges
      </p>
    <p>Accessibility challenges, in my humble view, can be overcome through empathy for the audience. 
        Most of the information can be boiled down to simple use cases in daily life that can be passed on as action instead of information. 
        A child picks up numbers by counting steps it climbs even without knowing how numbers work. 
        Having lived in places where drinking water was scarce, I am well aware that the internet and the information overload it brings is not much of an asset for most people in such areas.
        </p>
    <p>
    In such situations, the biggest challenge is not receiving information, but retaining it. For people like me with access to large computing systems, it is quite effortless for me to churn large volumes of data and pass it to another person. But if the person receiving does not have similar computing access, it is hard for them to store that information since there is no storage drive to dump it into. The only way most people with limited access to computing devices can store information is either on paper that gets carried in their hands or in their heads. Heads and hands are not great for storage either because they get used often to either ride a bike or hold more urgent information. That brings up the issue of prioritization. Most people with limited resources are really good with short term prioritization of stored information. For them, the amount of money to be spent on a daily commute may turn out to be a more urgent calculus than what the ecological cost of mining would be. 
        </p>
    <p>
    For such populations, the best way to deliver data-driven services is to:
    <ul>
        <li>Firstly, we must ensure that the subject matter is of utmost priority especially in the context that the population operates in. It is hard for people to gauge the context of such populations because ‘having’ brings a mindset that blinds one to conditions of ‘not having’. 
            This can be overcome by making a physical trip to the place and populations you wish to communicate the information to.  </li>
        <li>Secondly, we must translate information to action items with the best intentions. 
            People living with constrained resources are very risk-averse and any miscommunication can lead to deterioration of trust, which blocks any information being accepted beyond that point. </li>
        <li>Lastly, people need to know almost exact steps that will help them materialize the benefit from that information. 
            This is similar to the concept of “nudge” as described in the works of Richard Thaler and others working on behavioral economics. 
            Having that right nudge can help people feel secure about using that information and about the outcome it will bring.</li> 
        
    </ul>

</p>

<p>As for people that are not very data literate, I think that can refer to populations with access to good online and computing services.</p>

    <p>This is part of an ongoing Data Science Project where I am testing correlation between sunrise/sunset and Traffic Crash Severity. To do so, first I had to write this code in R to collect sunrise and sunset data for 15th of every month for 5 years. Data is scrapped off a website and organized in a table in appropriate formatting for further use.</p>

    <p>This is the direct link to the code for an application I developed called <a href="https://www.akshaymalik.com/philadelphia-crash-reporter/" >philadelphia-crash-reporter</a>. This application 
    pulls data from a City hosted public API and holds it on a Mapbox webmap. Once a user clicks a street, application processes a 50 feet buffer around the street centerline and collects all crashes falling within that buffer. 
    Then it aggregates these crashes into a table to the left of the map. This is again beta testing phase application. I am still working some kinks in the table. Any feedback is more than welcome.
